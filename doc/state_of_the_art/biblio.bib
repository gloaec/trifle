abstract = {Context is a key issue in interaction between human and computer, describing the surrounding facts that add meaning. In mobile computing location is usually used to approximate context and to implement context-aware applications. We propose that ultra-mobile computing, characterized by devices that are operational and operated while on the move (e.g. PDAs, mobile phones, wearable computers), can significantly benefit from a wider notion of context. To structure the field we introduce a working model for context, discuss mechanisms to acquire context beyond location, and application of context-awareness in ultra-mobile computing. We investigate the utility of sensors for context-awareness and present two prototypical implementations — a light-sensitive display and an orientation-aware PDA interface. The concept is then extended to a model for sensor fusion to enable more sophisticated context recognition. Based on an implementation of the model an experiment is described and the feasibility of the approach is demonstrated. Further, we explore fusion of sensors for acquisition of information on more sophisticated contexts.},

abstract = {Most protocols and applications are designed for connections that are fairly static. When a node changes its point of attachment to the Internet frequently, it must be able to rapidly adapt to the new environment. Traditionally, each application and protocol tries to do this independently of each other. In some cases, applications have been tailored to communicate with one other protocol layer to notice such changes. The main problem with this approach is that adding new protocols and applications to the node cannot be made in a generic way. In order to obtain at least some level of context awareness, protocols and applications must be specifically tailored to intercommunicate. This also adds complexity to application and protocol design, since protocols and applications perform a wide range of tasks for which they have not originally been designed. To overcome these problems, we add a new Context Aware Management (CAM) layer to the Internet Protocol stack. The purpose of CAM is to optimize the functionality of the node by monitoring the environment for changes and by adapting the behavior of the node accordingly. The protocols and applications thus perform the tasks for which they have been designed in the first place, and CAM makes the decisions regarding which protocols to use and with what parameters.},

This paper presents a novel policy-based, context-aware, service management framework for ensuring the efficient delivery and management of next generation services using autonomic computing principles. The novelty of this approach is its use of contextual information to drive policy-based changes that adapt network services and resources. Policies control the deployment and management of services and resources, as well as the software used to create, manage, and destroy these services and resources. Policies also control the distribution and deployment of the necessary components for fully managing the service lifecycle, and provide the efficiency and scalability necessary for supporting autonomic systems.},

abstract = {Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are being integrated with processors on the same motherboard or even chip in order to achieve flexible high-performance computing, and this may become main stream in chip multi-core architectures. However, the expensive FPGA area is often used inefficiently, with much of the logic idle at any given time. This work, motivated by the Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) concept in software, explores the possibility of “hardware DLLs” by finding ways for fast dynamic incremental reconfiguration of FPGAs. So doing would, among other things, enable same-function replication at any given time, with functions changing quickly over time, thereby enabling efficient exploitation of data parallelism at no additional hardware cost. We present two new multi-context FPGA architectures based on two different configuration storage architectures: local and centralized. Problems such as configuration storage and reconfiguration (time, power and space) overhead are considered. Well known area and power models are used in evaluating various approaches and in order to provide guidelines for matching architectures to target applications. Lastly, we provide insights into resulting scheduling issues. Our findings provide the foundation and “rules of the game” for subsequent development of reconfiguration schedulers and execution environments.},

abstract = {Open-world software is a paradigm which allows to develop distributed and heterogeneous software systems. They can be built by integrating already developed third-party services, which use to declare QoS values (e.g., related to performance). It is true that these QoS values are subject to some uncertainties. Consequently, the performance of the systems using these services may unexpectedly decrease. A challenge for this kind of software is to self-adapt its behavior as a response to changes in the availability or performance of the required services. In this paper, we develop an approach to model self-renconfigurable open-world software systems with stochastic Petri nets. Moreover, we develop strategies for a system to gain a new state where it can recover its availability or even improve its performance. Through an example, we apply these strategies and evaluate them to discover suitable reconfigurations for the system. Results will announce appropriate strategies for system performance enhancement.},

These are matters that are of central importance in system administration. There are many measures one might use to discuss the complexity of a solution to a problem: the number of lines of code required to solve the problem, the number of hours of planning needed, the CPU cycles expended during the task, the memory resources used to run the algorithms, etc. All of these are potential measures of difficulty or complexity, but to answer the question in a comprehensible way, we have to pose the question in a way that can be analyzed. A configuration is an assemblage of components and parts that makes up a complete system. The term appears both in system adminisration and in software engineering with analogous meanings. The algorithmic definition of complexity has been used to talk about the complexity of management problems in Network and System Administration. A pragmatic strategy for management would therefore be to pursue policies in terms of those operations that are easily computed. The question then remains, what one might be missing in such a framework.},

abstract = {As communications networks become increasingly dynamic, heterogeneous, less reliable, and larger in scale, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to effectively manage these networks using traditional approaches that rely on human monitoring and intervention to ensure they operate within desired bounds. Researchers and practitioners are pursuing the vision of autonomic network management, which we view as the capability of network entities to self-govern their behavior within the constraints of business goals that the network as a whole seeks to achieve. However, applying autonomic principles to network management is challenging for a number of reasons, including: (1) A means is required to enable business rules to determine the set of resources and/or services to be provided. (2) Contextual changes in the network must be sensed and interpreted, because new management policies may be required when context changes. (3) As context changes, it may be necessary to adapt the management control loops that are used to ensure that system functionality adapts to meet changing user requirements, business goals, and environmental conditions. (4) A means is required to verify modeled data and to add new data dynamically so that the system can learn and reason about itself and its environment. This article provides an introduction to the FOCALE autonomic network management architecture, which is designed to address these challenges.},

abstract = {The runtime management of the infrastructure providing service-based systems is a complex task, up to the point where manual operation struggles to be cost effective. As the functionality is provided by a set of dynamically composed distributed services, in order to achieve a management objective multiple operations have to be applied over the distributed elements of the managed infrastructure. Moreover, the manager must cope with the highly heterogeneous characteristics and management interfaces of the runtime resources. With this in mind, this paper proposes to support the configuration and deployment of services with an automated closed control loop. The automation is enabled by the definition of a generic information model, which captures all the information relevant to the management of the services with the same abstractions, describing the runtime elements, service dependencies, and business objectives. On top of that, a technique based on satisfiability is described which automatically diagnoses the state of the managed environment and obtains the required changes for correcting it (e.g., installation, service binding, update, or configuration). The results from a set of case studies extracted from the banking domain are provided to validate the feasibility of this proposal.},

We propose a service-centric operational management architecture for which we have defined a resource model based on the leading standards for characterizing systems, services and operations.

abstract = {The expansion of wireless communication and mobile hand-held devices makes it possible to deploy a broad range of applications on mobile terminals such as PDAs and mobile phones. The constant context changes of mobile users oblige them to carry out many deployment tasks of the same application in order to obtain an application whose configuration satisfies the context requirements. The difficulty and the frequency of these deployment tasks led us to study the deployment in a mobile environment and to look for a solution for the automation of the deployment adaptation to the context. This paper studies the deployment sensitivity to the context in order to identify the variable deployment parameters and to analyze the impact of the deployment adaptation on the production life cycle of applications. The contribution made by this paper consists in an innovative middleware entity called Context-Aware Deployment of COMPonents (CADeComp), which can be plugged into existing middleware deployment services. CADeComp defines a flexible data model that facilitates the tasks of component producers and application assemblers by allowing them to specify the meta-information required to adapt the deployment to the context. The advantage of CADeComp is that it is based on reliable adaptive mechanisms that are defined by a platform-independent model according to the MDA approach. We propose a mapping of the CADeComp model to CCM. CADeComp was implemented and evaluated on this platform. r},
